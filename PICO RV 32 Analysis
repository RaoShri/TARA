PicoRV32 is an open source CPU Core, built upon the RISC-V RV32IMC Instruction Set, and open hardware licensed under ISC license (Internet Systems Consortium). This CPU is meant to be used as auxiliary processor in FPGA designs, and is a very light weight processor that does not compromise timing closure when added to existing designs. Since this processor is built to be light weight and efficient timing considerations, it lacks security features. We shall evaluate the security aspects of this processor based on the specifications. 
This processor has a 32 bit address and data bus, whose control signals have to be valid over a valid-ready handshake. There is also a look ahead interface that provides information about the next memory transfer one clock earlier. There is no mechanism inbuilt into the core that provides security features over the data transferred. The core also has a single execution state and no partitioned secure and non secure execution states. It is observed that there is a very high risk involved in usage of PICORV32 as a Automotive ECU. Please refer to the image PICORV32 for the analysis.
